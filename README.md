This is a TypeScript boilerplate created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

It has Jest for testing and Babel for transpiling. JavaScript proposals for class properties and object rest spread is supported with two Babel plugins.

## About this Branch
This branch utilizes [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com) and [anime.js](https://animejs.com) for styles and animation, respectively. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is used for state management. Further improvement can be done by integrating anime.js with React Transition Group. ```anime.js``` is not used in the example here, but instead is replaced with an example showing Redux with a progress bar. Redux Thunk is also installed, if that is needed for asynchronous dispatches.

## Get Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. ```cd``` to the directory and run ```yarn install```.
3. ```yarn dev``` to run the development server.
